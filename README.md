# Awesome Astro
Curated resources on __building sites with Astro__, a brand new way to build static and server rendered sites, with cross-framework components, styling and reactive store support.

Astro is _super duper new_ and it won't be the right time to trust with really heavy loads, and something non-experimental. Although, it's getting there, and becoming more expressive and powerful, the APIs are still improving. This page aspires to collect all the valauble references out there, and be useful go-to resource when astro hits it's first stable version.

### Who am I?
Consider me just a _"new tech"_ explorer. I stumbled upon Astro, I liked it and I think it's pretty innovative, expressive and powerful way to build static + server-rendered sites. I have a blog series brewing, but will hold on to it till the APIs are stable. I also have a [starter-kit](https://github.com/one-aalam/astro-note) you can use.
