# Awesome Astro
Curated resources on __building sites with Astro__, a brand new way to build static and server rendered sites, with cross-framework components, styling and reactive store support.

Astro is _super duper new_, improving, and becoming more expressive + powerful, but few of the APIs are still evolving. This page aspires to collect all the valauble references out there, and be a useful go-to resource when astro hits it's first stable version.

### Who am I?
I'm a [Software Engineer](https://github.com/one-aalam) with 10+ yrs of experience and a _"new tech"_ explorer. I stumbled upon Astro, I liked it and I think it's pretty innovative way to build static + server-rendered sites. I have a blog series brewing, but will hold on to it till the APIs are stable. I also have a [starter-kit](https://github.com/one-aalam/astro-note) you can use.
